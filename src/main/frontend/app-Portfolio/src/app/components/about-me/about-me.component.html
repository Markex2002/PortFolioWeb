      <p>
        Nice to meet you, I'm Marco. I recently graduated as a Web Applications Developer.
        I am eager to put into practice the knowledge I have acquired during my studies,
        as well as to continue growing professionally and learning new languages and technologies.

        During the course, we learned languages and tools such as Java, HTML/CSS, Angular, SCSS,
        JavaScript, MySQL, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, etc.
        I am also fully open to learning new types of technologies and programming languages.
        I would love the opportunity to work with your team and continue learning.
      </p>

        Thank you very much for taking the time to read my introduction.
        I hope we can work together soon!
